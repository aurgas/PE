However, a few months ago they changed their chef / kitchen staff and the post servers that tasted pathetic all went sweet taste and the staff also did not have the skills of the food to serve and used to exercise more pressure to buy additional item. For a few months we thought that could be a short change but the food taste worse at each visit due to which we stopped going their. Tips to the owner to reassign the cook otherwise you will be in loss",

1.0,"I had a really disappointing experience with the ""Tikka fish"" that I ordered from Zomato. The packaging was of such poor quality that the fish was spoiled and unshakeable. I tried to join the restaurant several times to express my concerns, but they completely ignored me and even cut the call. To make things worse, when I visited the restaurant for dinner a few days ago, the staff's behavior was appalling. The toilet was dirty to the point where it was unusable. When I raised this problem, the staff answered grossly, rejecting my complaint with a comment on how a little dirt is normal.",

3.0,"While Indian food like tandoori and curry are good, Chinese food was extremely bad. Who puts kaccha paneer in hakka noodles? Chilli chicken was extremely bad. They charged an additional $40 to make Manchurian veg in the sauce. ... but all the dish was worth throwing in the trash. I fed chicken fried rice and chicken lollypop to street dogs. I think since Chinese is not their main menu, they had a help trying their hand at it. Instead they should remove Chinese dishes from the menu.",

To make matters worse, when I visited the restaurant for dine in a few days ago, the staff's behavior was appalling. The washroom was filthy to the point where it was unusable. When I raised this issue, the staff responded rudely, dismissing my complaint with a comment about how a little dirt is normal.

We ordered both vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines with variety of tandoori breads. We faced little issues related to service. As per occupancy the serving staff was not adequate. The dish we ordered as starters was served with the main course, that really spoiled the mood.

5.0,"After all these years and reviewing numerous restaurants in different countries, I am thrilled to write a review about the restaurant that my family owns (full disclosure).

It was an absolute delight to visit, dine in and soak in the experience HOT has to offer. The food (the best part), ambiance, the interior and exterior, the vibes, the options and everything else was outstanding.

Although on some days I found, the service to be slow as they were short staffed, but the food compensated for it. I loved Junglee maas, pastas, dahi k sholey, biryani, hara bhara kabab, cheesy chooza, shakes and coffees.

They also cater to special requests of Soup, khichdi, bland food for seniors and offer special pizza, pasta or french fries, shakes for kids.

The restaurant has an indoor and outdoor dining, cafe, banquet hall.  They sometimes host live music in the restaurant, more details of which can be accessed at IG-
h.o.t_houseoftandoor
It's a kids friendly restaurant so no one ever objects the kids from playing outdoors, around the fountain, jumping on the couches or tables. However, they do not offer a high chair for babies.

The restaurant also offer take out and food delivery options.  everytime my delivery from HOT arrived, it was packed with utmost care, ensuring that the food/ curry doesn't spill.

The restaurant has free parking spaces, clean washrooms, wheelchair accessibility (I even took my baby in stroller).

All in all, a pleasant experience for myself, my extended family, my little baby.",Vandana Lalwani

Nothing new about it), thick chocolate tremble (did not have foam, and taste a bit bitter), lachcha rabri. 1. steam momos - well filled and stuffed was ok. The outside cover was well cooked and not so thick. 2. Chocolate bhature (2) - Bhature were fluffy and quite large. Chocolat were not so tasty however. 3.

2.0,"The cleaning staff told me not to order dosa again and order something else they don't listen to. This means that it happens occasionally and the management staff don't listen to it, so the guys b attention. So I noticed the employees wearing shower caps but it's not enough about the hair growth in their hands. The chefs in Kanha seem to be maharaj type guys and not professional employees so hygiene seems to be a problem for me. Especially compared to the rates that is comparable to a good restaurant. U the guys will still make money but at the price of sorry hygiene not acceptable!!",

The quality of the food is good for some items while the average for other items.

1.0,"My recent visit to the Kanha Restaurant left me very dissatisfied, especially when he came to the candy. The elimination of the skillfully designed traditional options was a notable disappointment, and what remained to justify the too expensive menu. The candy lacked the wealth that I had come to associate at this place, with minimal trimmings and an excess of unhealthy sugar. It is discouraging to see a once reliable place for quality candy compromised on taste and value. The uneven price increase only added to the overall disappointment. For those looking for better value and quality, I strongly recommend exploring other local options. There is a nearby sugar shop that not only offers superior quality, but also at a more reasonable rate. Kanha Restaurant seems to have lost its way of providing delicious traditional candy, and I hope they reconsider their pricing strategy to provide a more satisfying experience to their customers.",

1.0,"Worst experience 👎👎👎

BAD FOOD-UNHYGIENIC-WORST PLACE EVER 👎👎👎

2 days back I went to this well known place for sweets and snacks. After consuming their snacks I felt very bad stomach ache, diarrhea and infection for good 15-16hours. I never thought it was because of their bad food quality.

But when my dad and mom faced the same issue next morning after having their sweet. I felt something is off. And when I checked their google reviews there are hundreds of customers complaining about their bad service, unhygienic food. All 3 of us got bad stomach infection and my mom had to suffer medication for 2days due to this food poisoning.

Worst worst worst experience.👎👎

Would never recommend them to anyone. Guys please be aware of such frauds with fake branding. I feel sorry for the people who didn’t check their reviews and paying them to get our health compromised.

The Amartsri Kulcha was not fresh. There was a bad smell coming from it, it seemed as if the stuff inside had gone bad.Do you want to ruin someone's health by feeding them such food? If someone's health gets spoiled by eating such food then who will be responsible for it? I also sent mail regarding this but there is no response I have lost all my money. I want my money back
We can't even feed such bad food to animals. I threw it in the dustbin.Time and money are completely taken but service is bad. Their food habits should be investigated. They want to spoil the situation by feeding them bad food.",Chanchal Khandelwal

I ordered Tanduri platter and it was awesome. It was served on a sizzler plate having Paneer Tikka, Kababs, stuff paneer, Daal makhani and Naan. Very filling for one person.
The restaurant also served many varieties of sweets, cakes, shakes etc.
Overall very good place for Vegitarians.",Rohit Bathwal

Cashier never asked or maintain queue for taking orders , even people should learn basic manners.

Seating area is nice
So overall a 3 star for quick food it is good.",Gaurav Mishra
4.0,"The two times we visited Kanha, we had a nice experience. We have tried steamed momos, cold coffee with ice cream (perfect), rainbow pastries (nice and soft), Chole bhature, Chinese platter, mysore masala dosa, Moroccan cheese loaf ( it tastes just like any other pizza with the same sauce, cheese and toppings. Nothing new about that), chocolate thick shake (had no froth, and tasted a bit off bitter), lachcha rabri.
1. Steamed momos - nicely filled and the stuffing was okay. The outer covering was well cooked and not so thick.
2. Chole bhature (2) - Bhature were fluffy and big enough. Chole were not so tasty though.
3. Chinese platter - included chowmein, fried rice, paneer Manchurian, manchurian. All were good and enough quantity. If you want to try Chinese items go for this instead of ordering separately.
4. Mysore masala dosa - sambhar and both chutneys were okay. Dosa was not so good...not recommended.
5. Lacha rabri - the best item of our list. Richly flavored and creamy.
6. Kala jamun were perfect. Must try all sweets I can say.
7. Chole kulcha were good.
8. Masala dosa was very nice too..crisp and tasty.
9. Chilli guava mojito and dark Belgium frappe tasted fine but the frappe could be better and creamier.
10. North Indian thali had good options including the sweet which tasted so pure and fresh. Good value for money.
11. Raj kachori was not at par with the other kanha outlets. There was no stuffing, instead just a lot of curd.
Overall, I think a lot of people left their plates with food still left in them. And we think that this branch has not the same taste that kanha is famous for.",Siddhi Khandelwal

2.0,"Found a hair in masala dosa. When complained the person said sorry and it’s happens. It happens?? The cleaning staff told me not to order dosa again and to order  something else as they don’t listen. This means this happens occasionally and the managerial staff don’t listen, so guys b careful. Also I have noticed staffs wearing shower caps but this isn’t enough what about the hair growth in their hands. The chefs in Kanha seem to be maharaj kind of guys and not professional staffs so hygiene does seem to be an issue to me. Specially compared to the rates which is comparable to a good restaurant. U guys will still make money but at the cost of hygiene sorry not acceptable!!",Tulika Sipani

Was served in an expert way and waiters were kind enough. Loved the understanding that they made.
Place was a good dine - in and I really appreciate the services provided for elders. Lifts and staircase both are available. Present on a high profile above the kanha. Really good and you should try it.
But only complaint I have was there was no receptionist. So we have had to wait 10 mins before they got our attention and chairs and tables were arranged. Four seater tables are there along with round curved sofas. We were like a big family so the tables were jointed to make one. Then the problem came, I got seat between two tables. Up and down...

Believe me you will get irritated by standing in queue buying coupons, then again standing in queue and waiting for your food to be prepared and served during evening hours. The food quality is good for some items whereas average for other items.

1.0,"My recent visit to Kanha Restaurant left me thoroughly dissatisfied, especially when it came to the sweets. The removal of cleverly crafted traditional options was a noticeable disappointment, and what remained failed to justify the overpriced menu.

The sweets lacked the richness I had come to associate with this place, with minimal toppings and an unpalatable excess of sugar. It's disheartening to see a once-reliable spot for quality sweets compromise on both taste and value. The uneven increase in prices only added to the overall disappointment.

For those seeking better value and quality, I strongly recommend exploring other local options. There's a sweet shop nearby that not only offers superior quality but also at a more reasonable rate. Kanha Restaurant seems to have lost its way when it comes to providing delightful traditional sweets, and I hope they reconsider their pricing strategy to provide a more satisfying experience for their customers",Girdhari Meena

The Ras malai was so sticky and gooey and could not even be scooped with a spoon. The gajar halva seemed like it was carrot scraps floating in fat. The khaman was too sour.

Every single item on the menu was crafted with precision and care, and each bite was simply delicious.

I also must mention the wonderful services of Highway King - the staff was very helpful and accommodating throughout my stay. They were quick to provide assistance and suggestions of what to order, and were very knowledgeable about their food and drinks.",taher khan
4.0,The food was very good. & Under budget. If ordered any vegetable or dish the quantity is so good. Even more than four people enjoy the dish in the same quantity. Food service was not good If you have placed your order then you will have to beg the waiter. And even then the order he brings you doesn't have everything. That is so surprising.,Ashish Shukla

2.0,No hygiene fly was littering around the whole restaurant area and makhi also was flying above our table. Food was cold not hot. Worst experience. Neither hygiene nor any good management. Worst scenario is managed by the manager seems like they lack experience after sitting on table they are going to approach you to say the table is already reserved also no reservation marking was done there on table. And flies were lottering around.,Millionaire Gang

Good Parathas , with dahi and nice Masala tea
Also tried Idli to see taste, though it wasn't soft, it was eatable. Sambar is typical North Indian style one, likely not authentic
Good option for early dinner 😁🍽️.",Yuvraj Badgoti

2.0,"They don’t have table management at all, We had to shift numerous number of tables unnecessarily.
We just went there to have a simple dinner, instead of that we were just roaming around here and there changing tables.

The overall customer experience turned out to very bad and with this sort of mood even good food tastes bad.
I would not recommend going to this restaurant on weekends and if you are going with your significant other, you will just be changing tables and get your mood ruined.",Rizil
1.0,Dirty place to have food. I don't how do this got 4 stars. Went there by seeing the rating and was disgusting.,Abhilash
4.0,"Located in close proximity to the Sindhi Camp Metro Station, TAXI CHICKINN - SINDHI CAMP emerges as a haven for non-vegetarian enthusiasts, particularly those with a penchant for delectable Tandoor preparations.

We embarked on our culinary journey with the Chicken Junglee Combo, a platter adorned with a creamy sauce, accompanied by both Rumali Roti and Tandoor Roti. The harmonious blend of flavors in this dish left an indelible mark on our taste buds, making it an unequivocal recommendation.

Turning our attention to the Tandoori Mushroom Tikka and Tandoori Soya Chaap, our experience was a mixed bag. While the former earned a satisfactory rating, the latter, Tandoori Soya Chaap, regrettably fell short of expectations, proving to be a letdown.

For the main course, we ventured into the realm of Chicken Fried Rice, only to find ourselves faced with disappointment. As Mumbaikars, we've grown accustomed to a distinct palette for Indo-Chinese cuisine, often encountered in the various Chinese joints dotting the city. This particular rendition, unfortunately, failed to meet those expectations.

In terms of overall ambience, TAXI CHICKINN offers a distinct and inviting atmosphere, setting it apart from the usual fare. The establishment's unique culinary offerings and ambiance make it a noteworthy destination for food enthusiasts.

On the economic front, it leans towards being pocket-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of diners. In summary, a visit to TAXI CHICKINN - SINDHI CAMP promises a distinctive dining experience, with some notable highlights and a few misses. For those seeking a unique culinary adventure, it's certainly worth a try.",Niv Shetye
1.0,Everything was bad. Just don't waste your money the cost of food is too much and the quality was very bad they don't use fresh chicken and food was terrible.  These guys have paid review as I saw 4 star and went there buy totally disappointed wasted my 560₹ (single person).,Abhishek Anand

So would request the owners to work on the furniture and basic hygiene.. food is killer..",Yash Kumar
